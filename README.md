# AdminToolBox
This is the place where I keep the code for my AdminToolBox PowerShell module.

Module contains bunch of functions that are helping with everyday taks. Functions are saved in individual folders and they are fetched inside psm1 file.


## Functions:

#### Get-ModuleHelp
This function was written to simplify using this module.
It loads all commands in module and shows them with numbers. Then you can enter function number and it will show you full help for that command.

This function can be used with any module.

#### Get-DiskSpace
Collect basic disk information from local and remote computers and export it to CSV.

#### New-DNSRecord
Create new A DNS record in AD integrated DNS zone using dnscmd tool.
