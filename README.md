# AdminToolBox
This is the place where i will keep a code for my Tool Box PowerShell module.

Module contains bunch of functions that are helping with everyday taks.


## Functions:

#### Get-ModuleHelp
This function was written to simplify using this module.
It loads all commands in module and shows them with numbers. Then you can enter function number and it will show you full help for that command.

This function can be used with any module.
